# Tunisia-democracy-analysis

This repository contains analysis and visualization of Tunisia's democratic trajectory using data from the **Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT)** dataset.

---

## Overview

This project examines Tunisia’s political development focusing on the **Polyarchy Index**, which measures the quality of democracy based on elections, civil liberties, and political participation. Tunisia's unique position following the Arab Spring makes it a compelling case study for democratic transitions, backsliding, and institutional challenges.
