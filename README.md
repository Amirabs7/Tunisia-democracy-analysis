Key Findings
Tunisia experienced decades of near-zero democracy scores before 2011.

The 2010–2011 Arab Spring triggered a significant democratic surge, captured by the Polyarchy Index.

Democratic gains peaked around 2012–2014 but declined gradually after 2019 due to political instability and institutional challenges.

The trajectory highlights the fragile nature of Tunisia’s democratic transition, emphasizing the need for continued democratic safeguards.
