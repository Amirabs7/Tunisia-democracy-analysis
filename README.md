## **Tunisia and Global Democratization: Insights from V-Dem ERT Data**  



## üìå Overview  
This project provides a data-driven analysis of democratic transitions, focusing on Tunisia‚Äôs post-Arab Spring trajectory while situating it within global patterns of democratization and reversal. Using the Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT) dataset, this work quantifies the dynamics of regime change, highlights critical turning points, and compares Tunisia to other countries with democratization episodes since 2000.

The goal is to provide an evidence-based perspective on the fragility, resilience, and global patterns of democratization, offering  insights for researchers and policymakers.

## üîÅ Reproducibility & Data Provenance

**Source:** V-Dem ERT dataset (subset for Tunisia)  

**Cleaning/Filtering:** 
- Subset Tunisia data (`country_name == "Tunisia"`)  
- Removed non-episodes (`dem_ep_outcome_agg > 0`) for global plots  
- Created binary outcome for logistic regression (`success_binary = 1 if dem_ep_outcome_agg == 4`)

**Reproducibility:**  
- R version >= 4.3  
- Packages: ERT, dplyr, ggplot2, tibble  

**Random Seed:** 42 (used for reproducible plots and simulations)  

**Session Info:** Run `sessionInfo()` to reproduce exact environment

## üìä Key Visualizations and Key Insights :

### 1. Tunisia‚Äôs Democracy Score Over Time  


[![Polyarchy Index](Democracy%20score%20over%20time%20Tunisia.png)](Democracy%20score%20over%20time%20Tunisia.png)  
*Post-2011 surge, 2014 peak, and gradual decline after 2019.*  


Tunisia‚Äôs Democratic Journey :

- Authoritarian Baseline (Pre-2011): Rigid autocracy with extremely low Polyarchy scores (~0.08).
- Arab Spring Breakthrough (2010-2011): Polyarchy jumped from 0.08 ‚Üí 0.45 (+463%), driven by protests and Ben Ali‚Äôs ouster.
- Democratic Peak & Consolidation (2012-2014): Polyarchy reached 0.55 with free elections, press freedom, and a landmark constitution.
- Gradual Backsliding (Post-2019): Decline to ~0.35 due to presidential power grabs, institutional weakening, and socioeconomic stagnation.

Root Causes of Democratic Erosion :

- Chronic socioeconomic gridlock, corruption, and regional inequality.
- Executive power consolidation (2021 constitutional crisis).
- Weak institutional safeguards and elite consensus.
  


### 2. Global Democratization Outcomes  : 


[![Success Rates](Outcomes%20of%20democratization%20episodes%20gloabl.png)](Outcomes%20of%20democratization%20episodes%20gloabl.png)  


- Since 2000, most democratization episodes failed or stagnated.Only ~17% succeeded in reaching stable democracy (V-Dem ERT, 2024).
- Partial democratization (some liberalization but not full democracy) is common.
- Democratization is the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of transitions collapse back into authoritarianism or stall in hybrid regimes. Tunisia‚Äôs failed attempt fits this broader global pattern, showing that even with international support and initial enthusiasm, structural weaknesses (economic crises, elite resistance, weak institutions) usually prevent consolidation.




### 3. Starting Democracy Levels of Successful Transitions Since the 2000s : 


[![Starting Levels](Starting%20Democracy%20Levels%20of%20Successful%20Transitions%20Since%202000.png)](Starting%20Democracy%20Levels%20of%20Successful%20Transitions%20Since%202000.png)

- Successful democratizations since 2000 usually started in regimes that were not fully authoritarian, but had medium democracy levels (Polyarchy ~0.4‚Äì0.5).
- Almost no cases of success came from ‚Äúhard‚Äù authoritarian regimes (Polyarchy <0.2).
- Full authoritarian collapses almost never democratize successfully. Success depends on pre-existing pluralism, semi-open institutions, or organized opposition. Tunisia was an unusual case: it started from a fairly authoritarian baseline (Polyarchy ~0.25), which helps explain why consolidation failed ‚Äî the institutional and economic foundations weren‚Äôt strong enough to sustain democracy.


### 4. Success of Democratization Episodes Over Time : 


[![Success of Democratization](success%20of%20democratization%20episodes%20over%20time.png)](success%20of%20democratization%20episodes%20over%20time.png)


- From 1900‚Äìmid 20th century, almost all democratization attempts failed.Late 20th century (1970s‚Äì1990s) saw more successes (e.g., Latin America, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe). Since 2000, successes are rare again, with failure/stagnation dominating.
- The global ‚Äúthird wave‚Äù of democracy (1970s‚Äì1990s) was historically unique. The post‚Äì2000 era has been much harsher: authoritarian resilience, resource wealth, geopolitical rivalries, and weak international pressure mean that most attempts crash. Tunisia wasn‚Äôt a unique tragedy ‚Äî it was part of a systemic reversal in global democratization


### 5.Post- democratization episode status by country :


[![Post-Democratization Status](post%20democratization%20episode%20status%20by%20country.png)](post%20democratization%20episode%20status%20by%20country.png)


- This graph focuses on other democratization episodes since 2000, mainly the following countries: Benin, Bolivia, Fiji, Honduras, Thailand, Zambia.
- Partial democracies sometimes struggle more to consolidate due to hybrid instability.
- Successful transitions often start from very low or intermediate institutional levels, not already ‚Äúsemi-free‚Äù states.

**‚ùì Why This Case Study Matters: A Beacon for the Arab World** :

Tunisia is a case study with both national and global significance:

- Provides lessons for the Arab world and transitional regimes globally.
- Demonstrates how revolutions can succeed initially but face long-term consolidation challenges.
- Highlights the fragility of democratic institutions and the importance of robust governance.
