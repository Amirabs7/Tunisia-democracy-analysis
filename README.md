# Tunisia Democratic Trajectory Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of Tunisia's democratic trajectory using the **Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT)** dataset. The project explores democratization episodes, political trends, and predictive modeling to understand Tunisia’s fragile democracy post-Arab Spring.

## Key Findings

- Tunisia showed a long period of authoritarianism with near-zero democracy scores before 2011.
- The 2010–2011 Arab Spring triggered a sharp democratic surge reflected in the Polyarchy Index.
- Democratic gains peaked between 2012 and 2014, then declined gradually, especially after 2019.
- Recent political challenges illustrate the fragile nature of Tunisia’s democratic transition.
