# 🇹🇳 Tunisia's Democratic Trajectory Analysis  
*Exploring Rise, Reversal, and Fragility using V-Dem ERT Data*

Tunisia had in the past 15 years a unique political trajectory in the MENA region startint with the Arab Spring back in 2011 . This repository presents an in-depth, data-driven analysis of **Tunisia’s democratic journey** since the Arab Spring. Built entirely in **R**, the project leverages the **Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Episodes of Regime Transformation (ERT)** dataset to uncover trends, turning points, and long-term risks in Tunisia's fragile transition to democracy.

> 📍 **Data Source**:  
> [V-Dem ERT Dataset](https://www.v-dem.net/data/ert-dataset/) – Episodes of Regime Transformation (v2)

## 📈 Key Insights

- Before 2011: Tunisia ranked extremely low on democracy scales, with nearly zero political competition or participation under Ben Ali.
- 2010–2011: The Arab Spring sparked a democratic breakthrough, captured in the ERT dataset as a major regime change.
- 2012–2014: Democratic indicators peaked as Tunisia drafted a new constitution, held free elections, and gained international recognition.
- Post-2019 Decline: Political instability, presidential overreach, and weakened institutions triggered a democratic regression — visible in falling polyarchy and liberal democracy scores.
- The Trajectory Remains Fragile: Despite democratic gains, Tunisia's experience shows how easily reforms can reverse without strong safeguards.
- This project is an illustration of Tunisia different political trajectories since 2011.
